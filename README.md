Game is gonna be simmilar to Heroes of Might and Magic but RTS Style for the map traversion instead of turn based.
Players will begin in their "Area", and will begin going around gathering resources and batteling npcs to get better armys. Battles are gonna be in a different battle scene.
At different marks of the game, players will be allowed to go to areas of other players to try and fight them. the last player who survives, wins.

At the end, game is souposed to have 8 factions so an 8 man multiplayer game (1 player for each faction). however it can be played with any number of players under 8.
